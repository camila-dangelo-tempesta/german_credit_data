## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

### 1.1 Summary

This experiment aims to create a predictive model for classify the credit risk of customers of a banking institution.

### 1.2 Description

This experiment aims to demonstrate the process of building a model rating system to predict the risk of granting credit to customers of a Bank. We will use a dataset to build and train our model.

### 1.3 Objective

The objective will be to predict the risk that each customer offers to the bank, in the time to grant a line of credit. The predictive model must be quite accurate, because granting credit to a customer with poor payment potential, can bring a great loss to the bank.

## 2. Data

The dataset [German Credit Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)) will be used to build and train the model in this experiment.

This dataset is based on real data generated by a researcher at the University of Hamburg, Germany.

The dataset contains 1000 observations and 20 variables, representing customer data, such as: checking account status, credit history, current credit amount, employability, residency, age, etc.

  - The **Statlog German Credit Data Set**: This dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. 
   Comes in two formats (one all numeric). Also comes with a cost matrix
